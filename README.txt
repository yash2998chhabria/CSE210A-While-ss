Welcome to Alex Salman simple while program :)

You will need the following to run my program, enter input and see result:

1 - Install python 3.8
2 - On your terminal, change your directory to cse210A-asgtest-hw4-while-ss folder
3 - Type in $ python3 while-ss.py
4 - Enter the statement you want to execute such as,
	x := 3 ; if ( x < 5 ) then x := x + 1 else x := x - 1
5 - You will see the result on the next line, for the above example, it's
	⇒ skip; if (x<5) then { x := (x+1) } else { x := (x-1) }, {x → 3}
	⇒ if (x<5) then { x := (x+1) } else { x := (x-1) }, {x → 3}
	⇒ x := (x+1), {x → 3}
	⇒ skip, {x → 4}

Thank you for using my program and stay tuned for more advanced programs!
